# ðŸ“… Day 3 â€“ JavaScript Events, Forms & Mini Project

Today, I **dived deeper into DOM manipulation** and explored advanced event handling and form processing in JavaScript. Building upon what I learned earlier, I expanded my understanding with practical applications and interaction patterns.

## âœ… Topics Covered

- Advanced DOM usage: dynamically creating and modifying elements (`createElement`, `appendChild`, `innerHTML`)
- `addEventListener()` with special options:
  - `once: true`
  - `capture: true`
  - Event bubbling vs. capturing
  - Preventing propagation using `e.stopPropagation()`
- Handling form submissions:
  - Preventing default submit behavior with `e.preventDefault()`
  - Validating and reading input values
- Using `setTimeout()` to delay transitions and enable smooth UI effects

## ðŸ›  Mini Project

As a practical task, I built a **To-Do App** (inside the `project/` folder) that allows users to:
- Add and delete tasks dynamically
- View animated fade-in/fade-out transitions using Tailwind CSS
- Interact with form elements smoothly

Full project details are available in [`project/README.md`](./project/README.md).
