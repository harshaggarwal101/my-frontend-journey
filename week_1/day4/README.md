# 🧠 Day 4 – ES6 Features in JavaScript

Today I explored some key ES6 features that modernize and simplify JavaScript development.  
I focused on writing clean, modern code using the following:

- ✅ `let` vs `const` – differences in mutability and block scoping  
- ✅ Arrow functions – syntax variations and implicit return  
- ✅ Template literals – for cleaner, multi-line strings and string interpolation  
- ✅ Default parameters – to handle missing function arguments  
- ✅ Spread & Rest operators:  
  - Spread: to expand arrays and objects  
  - Rest: to gather arguments or array parts

## 🎯 Bonus Practice – CodeWars Katas

As an extra challenge, I solved the following JavaScript katas on CodeWars:

1. 🧩 [**Descending Order**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5467e4d82edf8bbf40000155) – Rearranged digits of a number in descending order  
2. 🗣️ [**Disemvowel Trolls**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52fba66badcd10859f00097e) – Removed vowels from offensive comments  
3. 👻 [**Selective Fear of Numbers**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55b1fd84a24ad00b32000075) – Filtered out scary numbers (666 or divisible by 13)  
4. ➕ [**Sum of Two Lowest Positive Integers**](https://www.codewars.com/kata/558fc85d8fd1938afb000014) – Found the sum of the two smallest positive numbers in an array
