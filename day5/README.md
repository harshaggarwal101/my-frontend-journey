# ⚙️ Day 5 – Advanced JavaScript: Destructuring, Promises & Async/Await

Today I deepened my understanding of modern JavaScript concepts, focusing on asynchronous programming and ES6+ features for cleaner, more reliable code.

- ✅ **Destructuring** – Extracted values from arrays and objects using concise syntax  
- ✅ **Promises** – Used `.then()` and `.catch()` to handle async flows and chain tasks  
- ✅ **Async & Await** – Wrote cleaner asynchronous code with `async` functions and `await`  
- ✅ **Real-world Use Cases** – Learned how these concepts are used with APIs, databases (Node.js), and timers like `setTimeout`  
- ✅ **Error Handling** – Handled errors gracefully using `try...catch` blocks

## 🎯 Bonus Practice – Async Examples

As extra practice, I wrote:

1. 📦 A chain of promises simulating step-by-step loading  
2. 🕒 A delayed `setTimeout` wrapped in a promise  
3. 🌐 A mock `fetch()` call using `async/await` with `try...catch` for error handling
