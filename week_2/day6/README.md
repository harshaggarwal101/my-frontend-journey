# ðŸ”„ Day 6 â€“ Revision (Week 2)

## ðŸ“˜ What I Revised Today

- Reviewed **Fetch API** concepts:
  - `fetch()` with `.then()` and `async/await`
  - Error handling using `try/catch`
  - Displaying loading indicators and friendly error messages
- Revisited **localStorage** usage:
  - `setItem()`, `getItem()`, `removeItem()`, `clear()`
  - Storing and retrieving objects/arrays using `JSON.stringify()` & `JSON.parse()`
  - Persisting and dynamically rendering stored data
- Practiced **DOM Manipulation**:
  - Event listeners and delegation
  - Dynamically creating, updating, and removing elements
  - Using `dataset` attributes for data handling
- Reviewed **JavaScript fundamentals**:
  - ES6 features (arrow functions, template literals, spread/rest, destructuring)
  - `Date` object usage for time-based projects
  - `setInterval()` for real-time updates
