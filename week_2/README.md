# 📅 Week 2 – Frontend Development Roadmap

**Timeline:** July 22 – August 11, 2025  
**Theme:** Fetch API, localStorage, DOM Projects, and Problem Solving (JavaScript)

---

## 📘 Overview

Week 2 focused on mastering **asynchronous JavaScript** with the Fetch API, persistent data storage using **localStorage**, hands-on DOM manipulation projects, and algorithmic problem-solving via LeetCode.  
By the end of the week, I strengthened my fundamentals and created multiple mini-projects that demonstrated real-world application of these skills.

  - Build a counter app with persistent state in localStorage
- **API Project with Search & Filters**
  - Fetch and store data in state  
  - Implement client-side search and filtering
- **JavaScript30 Practice**
  - Pick 2 projects (e.g., Array Cardio, Flex Panel Gallery, CSS Variables + JS)  
  - Write `NOTES.md` for each
- **LeetCode + Patterns**
  - Practice two pointers, sliding window, and hash maps  
  - Solve: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock, Move Zeroes, Contains Duplicate, Plus One
- **Mini Hackathon Day**
  - Build a single-page dashboard with search, data rendering, and optional recent search persistence
- **Reflection & React Prep**
  - Write `WEEK3-LOG.md` with projects, struggles, and readiness for React  
  - Read about components, props, and state
