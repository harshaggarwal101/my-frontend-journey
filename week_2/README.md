# 📅 Week 2 – Frontend Development Roadmap

**Timeline:** July 22 – August 11, 2025  
**Theme:** Fetch API, localStorage, DOM Projects, and Problem Solving (JavaScript)

---

## 📘 Overview

Week 2 focused on mastering **asynchronous JavaScript** with the Fetch API, persistent data storage using **localStorage**, hands-on DOM manipulation projects, and algorithmic problem-solving via LeetCode.  
By the end of the week, I strengthened my fundamentals and created multiple mini-projects that demonstrated real-world application of these skills.
