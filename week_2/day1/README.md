# 🐱 Day 1 – Fetch API in Depth (Week 2)

## 📘 What I Learned Today

- Refreshed my knowledge of `async/await` and `try/catch` in JavaScript.
- Learned how to use `fetch()` to make GET requests to external APIs.
- Understood how to handle async behavior using both `.then()` and `async/await`.
- Applied `try/catch` blocks to handle errors during fetch operations.
- Improved user experience by showing a "Loading..." message during data fetches.
- Learned to handle API failure scenarios gracefully.
