# ⏰ Day 4 – Analog Clock and Drumstick website (Week 2)

## 📘 What I Learned Today

- Practiced **absolute positioning** to place clock numbers in a circular layout.
- Used **trigonometric functions** (`Math.sin` & `Math.cos`) to calculate exact positions for each number.
- Learned how to rotate elements dynamically using **CSS transforms** (`rotate()`).
- Understood how to create **smooth real-time updates** using `setInterval()`.
- Improved DOM manipulation skills by dynamically generating clock numbers.
- Applied **JavaScript Date object** to fetch and display current time in real-time.
