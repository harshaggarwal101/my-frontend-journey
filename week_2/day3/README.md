# 😂 Day 3 – Saved Jokes App (Week 2)

## 📘 What I Learned Today

- Understood how to save data (jokes) persistently using `localStorage`.
- Practiced checking and preventing duplicate entries in localStorage arrays.
- Strengthened skills in DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering and deleting saved jokes.
